<div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Klasa's SettingsGateway module</h1></div>

This is an approximately 1:1 fork of the `@klasa/settings-gateway` module, which got lost while repos changed owners and Dirigeants (eventually) fell through. The dev tooling was changed bwhen it got passed down to @skyra-project but the core code is the same.

**This fork exists under Dirigeants' & @skyra-project's licence.**
**It also uses my fork of klasa, located in https://github.com/cfanoulis/klasa-framework**
